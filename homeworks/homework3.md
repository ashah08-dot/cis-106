    Scenario 3: Linux + Gaming
Johanna is a gamer. She loves playing RPGs and Indie games. Johanna makes a living streaming her gaming sessions on Twitch and YouTube. She is angry because, during one of her live streams, windows 10 decided to install an update. All of Johanna’s games are available for Linux and she is good enough with computers to be able to pick up using a new operating system. Which Linux distribution would you recommend Johanna to try?

    Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s dinosaur PC?
